# Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
Repository for Final Project for Getting and Creating Data Course in Coursera

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. Students will be graded by your peers on a series of yes/no questions related to the project. You will be required to submit: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

Students should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each   subject.

# Contents of this Github Folder
1.- Readme file (this one)
2.- CodeBook (Explaining Dataset)
3.- R Script - RunAnalysis.R (Script that processes the data provided for this Project)
4.- Tidy Dataset (final file produced by script with required steps to generate Tidy Data)

# How to make the script work?

Data used by the script is located in the following folders:

Test Data

"C:/Data/R/Getting and Creating Data Week4/Week 4 Final Project/UCI HAR Dataset/test"

Train Data

"C:/Data/R/Getting and Creating Data Week4/Week 4 Final Project/UCI HAR Dataset/train"

Features and  Activities 

"C:/Data/R/Getting and Creating Data Week4/Week 4 Final Project/UCI HAR Dataset"

Once the data is located in the folders above, run the script to create the tidy.txt file
